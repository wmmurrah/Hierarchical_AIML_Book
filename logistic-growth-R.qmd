title: "Logistic Growth Modeling: Understanding Theoretical Parameters"
---

## Overview
This tutorial focuses on modeling growth curves using the Logistic function, emphasizing the interpretability of theoretical parameters such as the asymptote, inflection point, and growth rate. It builds on the foundational knowledge from the introductory tutorial on nonlinear growth models, with a hands-on approach for implementation in both R (using the brms package) and Python (using PyMC3).

## Objectives
1. Understand the functional form and theoretical parameters of the Logistic curve.
2. Specify, fit, and interpret Logistic growth models in R and Python.
3. Investigate differences in growth parameters by demographic groups, including SES, race, and gender.
4. Compare models using Bayesian model comparison techniques and evaluate model fit with posterior predictive checks.

## Part 1: Introduction to the Logistic Curve
### Motivation and Context
The Logistic growth curve is widely used in modeling growth processes, particularly in educational achievement and cognitive development, where growth accelerates rapidly before slowing as it approaches a maximum level (asymptote). In this context, the Logistic curve helps to understand important developmental milestones, critical periods for intervention, and long-term achievement potential.

### Functional Form of the Logistic Curve
- Equation: \( y(t) = \frac{\alpha}{1 + \exp(-\beta (t - \gamma))} \)
- Parameters:
  - \( \alpha \): Asymptote (Maximum achievement level)
  - \( \beta \): Growth rate
  - \( \gamma \): Inflection point (Timing of most rapid development)

### Interpretability and Theoretical Implications
The Logistic curve provides interpretable parameters directly linked to theoretical constructs. For example:
- The **inflection point** indicates the timing of the most rapid change, which can be used to identify critical developmental periods or windows of opportunity for educational interventions.
- The **asymptote** represents the maximum potential achievement level, useful for examining educational disparities by demographic groups.

## Part 2: Logistic Growth Model in R using brms
### Data Preparation
To model the logistic growth curve using the brms package in R, we first need to prepare the data. This example uses the 2011 ECLS-K dataset to examine academic achievement trajectories. We focus on demographic differences by SES, race, and gender.

### Loading Required Packages
```r
# Install and load necessary packages
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "brms", "cmdstanr", "mice"))
library(tidyverse)
library(brms)
library(cmdstanr)  # Required backend for brms
library(mice)  # For multiple imputation of missing data
```

### Data Preparation and Exploration
```r
# Load the dataset
# Assume the dataset is saved as 'eclsk_data.csv'
data <- read_csv('eclsk_data.csv')

# Explore the data
str(data)
summary(data)

# Subset relevant variables
selected_vars <- c("childid", "race", "sex", "ses", "age_entry", "age_test", "math_score")
data_subset <- data[, selected_vars]

# Handle missing data using multiple imputation
imp_data <- mice(data_subset, m = 5, method = 'pmm', maxit = 50, seed = 123)
```

### Specifying the Logistic Growth Model
The logistic growth model is specified using a custom non-linear formula:
```r
logistic_formula <- bf(
  math_score ~ alpha / (1 + exp(-beta * (age_test - gamma))),
  alpha ~ 1 + race + sex + ses + age_entry,
  beta ~ 1 + race + sex + ses,
  gamma ~ 1 + race + sex + ses,
  nl = TRUE
)

# Priors for interpretability
logistic_priors <- c(
  prior(normal(0, 10), nlpar = "alpha"),
  prior(normal(0, 1), nlpar = "beta"),
  prior(normal(0, 10), nlpar = "gamma")
)
```

### Fitting the Model
```r
# Fit the model using brms
fit_logistic <- brm(
  formula = logistic_formula,
  data = complete(imp_data, action = 1),  # Use first imputed dataset
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = logistic_priors,
  chains = 4,
  iter = 4000,
  cores = 4,
  seed = 123
)
```

### Model Diagnostics and Posterior Checks
```r
# Model summary
summary(fit_logistic)

# Trace plots for convergence diagnostics
plot(fit_logistic)

# Posterior predictive checks
pp_check(fit_logistic)
```

### Interpretation of Parameters
- **Alpha (Asymptote)**: Maximum achievement level.
- **Beta (Growth Rate)**: Speed of development.
- **Gamma (Inflection Point)**: Timing of most rapid growth.
